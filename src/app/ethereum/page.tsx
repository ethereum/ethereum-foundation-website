        <h1>What is Ethereum?</h1>

        <p>Ethereum is a technology built for the public good.</p>

        <p>
          It is a worldwide system, an{" "}
          <strong>
            open-source platform <sup>1</sup>
          </strong>{" "}
          to write computer code that stores and automates digital databases
          using smart contracts, without relying upon a{" "}
          <strong>
            central intermediary <sup>2</sup>
          </strong>
          , solving trust with{" "}
          <strong>
            cryptographic <sup>3</sup>
          </strong>{" "}
          techniques.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ethereum is not owned by anybody, and it is built and maintained by
          thousands of people, organizations, and users all over the world; it
          is a commons from which everyone can benefit. In the code, there are
          incentives for participants to help secure the system. Access to
          Ethereum is open to everyone; no permission is required. The network
          is powered by{" "}
          <strong>
            nodes<sup>4</sup>
          </strong>{" "}
          that anyone can run. The global network of Ethereum nodes all together
          work to maintain a shared{" "}
          <strong>
            state <sup>5</sup>
          </strong>{" "}
          - a foundation of trust upon which more complex human relationships
          can grow.

              Open Source software is freely available code that anyone can
              read, improve, and distribute. Ethereum is Free Software in the
              &apos;freedom&apos; sense – anyone may inspect the code to learn
              more about it, anyone may run the code to secure the network, and
              anyone may distribute the software to help one&apos;s neighbor.{" "}

            <li>
              Many networks require a trusted operator or central intermediary
              in order to function. Ethereum and related blockchain technologies
              enable a network that does not have this requirement, resulting in
              a resilient and highly distributed system that does not rely on
              any special authority for its operation or security.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              Cryptography is the science of &apos;secret writing&apos; – using
              mathematical techniques, cryptography enables the encoding and
              decoding of information between parties, so that communication can
              take place over public channels securely.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              Nodes are individual points that connect together to form a
              network. In the case of Ethereum, a single node is one computer
              that runs an Ethereum client to maintain consensus over the global
              shared state. An Ethereum node can be run by anyone, anywhere
              using widely available computer hardware and an open source
              ethereum client.{" "}

              &apos;state machine&apos; (not &apos;nation state&apos;). The
              Ethereum state is like a programmable &apos;permanent record&apos;
              of accounts, balances, and other details – one that is highly
              reliable and credibly neutral.{" "}
